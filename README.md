# Welcome to My Chaotic GitHub Realm 🚀  
> Where the code is made up, and the bugs don’t matter.  

### 👨‍💻 About Me  
- Professional **Ctrl + C, Ctrl + V Engineer**.  
- Debugging since birth. Still haven’t found the issue.  
- I write code that *sometimes* compiles and *occasionally* runs.  
- **Stack Overflow's #1 fan** (not contributor, just fan).  
- I document my code by leaving `TODO:` comments everywhere.  

### 🛠️ My Tech Stack  
- **Frontend:** Copy-Paste from CodePen.  
- **Backend:** Stack Overflow snippets, but they “work on my machine.”  
- **Database:** Whatever I can SELECT * FROM.  
- **Version Control:** `git commit -m "fixed stuff"`, `git push --force`.  

### 📈 GitHub Stats (a.k.a. My Sins Exposed)  
🔥 Most commits:  
- `Added semicolon.`  
- `Fixed a bug. Probably.`  
- `Reverted everything because I broke production.`  

🚀 Most used tools:  
- **Rubber duck debugging** (it listens better than my team).  
- **Console.log()** (true DevOps).  
- **Stack Overflow’s dark mode** (for extra senior dev energy).  

### 📝 My Coding Principles  
- **DRY:** Do not Repeat Yourself (unless copy-pasting, then YOLO).  
- **KISS:** Keep It Simple, Stupid (but overcomplicate everything anyway).  
- **YAGNI:** You Ain’t Gonna Need It (until you delete it, then you will).  
- **WTFs/min:** The only real metric for code quality.  

### 🚀 What I’m Currently Working On  
- Fixing the bug I introduced yesterday.  
- Making minor changes and calling it a **major refactor**.  
- Debugging in production because *what is a local environment anyway?*  
- Pretending to understand `Regex`.  

### 🤝 How to Reach Me  
- **Email:** [probably_fake_email@domain.com](mailto:probably_fake_email@domain.com)  
- **Carrier pigeon:** Please attach stack traces.  
- **LinkedIn:** Just kidding. I only exist in dark mode.
